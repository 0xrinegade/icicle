# ICICLE example: use Polynomial API to implement Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof (FRI)

The primary goal of FRI is to enable the efficient verification of polynomial evaluations over large fields, which is a crucial aspect of many cryptographic protocols, especially those involving polynomial commitment schemes.
Integrating FRI within RISC0 or similar systems can significantly improve their performance by reducing the computational and storage requirements for handling polynomial commitments.
